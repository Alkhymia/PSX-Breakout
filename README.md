# PSX Breakout
Breaks out all of the signals from the PSX AV out so you can easily access them. 

# Operation
Plug in and go.

## HD15 SYNC Selector 
Located on the back left of the board, this switch determines which signal goes to the HD15 port - CVBS or LUMA.

# Parts
Refer to BOM.csv for all components. For the support leg, use any appropriately long brass/metal m3 standoff/pillar and screw a rubber foot to the bottom. Solder a 5mm spring clamp to the bottom of the board to adjust the height.
For the phat PS3, standoffs may need to be screwed into each other (stacked) to reach the needed height.

# Case
The incredible [Magic Trashman](https://twitter.com/MagicTrashman) was kind enough to design 3D printable cases for both my Nintendo and PSX breakouts. They are under the same license as the PCB and are free to use, but if you order through thingiverse you can leave him a nice tip. Current designs fit the height of the original PS1 and the original SNES, but can be easily adjusted for height if you have some basic 3D design skills. They are held together with 2x 14mm M3 machine screws.

Bonus: If you plug the Nintendo/Sony connector into the console and screw the PCB into the bottom of the case, it makes it a lot easier to solder the connector to the board as it is held in place.
